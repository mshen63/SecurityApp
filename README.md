# On My Way
## Inspiration
As college students navigating a bustling metro cityscape, we frequently encountered dangerous situations where we wished we had a friend come to our aid. If only there was a way to notify nearby students in order to request and receive help within minutes. We designed On My Way to address these concerns and provide a way for victims to contact their peers in a safe and efficient manner.

## Functionality
On My Way allows users to request help with a push of a button. Nearby users will receive a notification, and once they accept the request, they are provided with navigational directions to locate the victim. Additionally, the victim will have the option to communicate with their rescuer via WiFi call in order to provide more information. 

## How We Built It
After utilizing Android Studio to build the app, we implemented the Google Maps SDK in order to display location markers on a map. We also stored location and login information in a Cloud Firestore database. WiFi calling was incorporated using ___, and notifications were generated using ___.
